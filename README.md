# Computer-Networks-Project1-File-Transfer-Protocol-FTP-
The project is a simplified version of the File Transfer Protocol(FTP). It consists of two files: FTPclient.c and FTPserver.c. 
The FTP server works concurrently and is able to handle simultaneous users' requests through establishing a TCP connection.
